      <h2 class="title">Our mission</h2>

      <p>The OMG Network is a public and open source initiative, built by OmiseGO, a subsidiary of Omise Holdings funded by a crowdsale in 2017.</p>
      <p>Being public and open source allows us, the community of builders and stakeholders, to step in and get organized to defend the values that we share with OmiseGO : transparency, integrity and inclusion in a new decentralized finance system, backed by an amazing blockchain that does not make concessions on security and decentralization.</p>
      <p>With help from OmiseGO, we are currently on a mission to bring more transparency in the network's design decisions, current state and provide better educational resources.</p>
      <p>The goal, in a common agreement with OmiseGO, is to increase the network's adoption and ultimately openly distribute the codebase maintenance and general upkeep of the network. Before that, OmiseGO will make sure the network is in a good condition, secure and healthy, and that our community is ready to receive this responsibility. This transfer won't happen overnight and will require a good number of talents and devoted contributors to grow our ranks so if you heard our call, come BUILD with us !</p>
